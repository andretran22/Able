# ABLE
iOS app for CS371L to connect people that can help one another.


## Notes
1. Everytime you __git pull__, make sure to run __pod install__ at the top-level before coding/running the app.
This will build the __Able.xcworkspace__ with the most updated dependencies from the Podfile. 

2. __IMPORTANT!__ Work in the __Able.xcworkspace__ workspace not __Able.xcodeproj__. The first one is the one with the Pods and dependencies 


## To Do
Will consider removing Able.xcodeproj from GitHub and leaving just Able.xcworkspace to avoid confusion.
