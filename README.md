# Able
iOS app for CS371L to connect people that can help one another.


# Notes
1. Everytime you 'git pull', make sure to run "pod install' at the top-level before coding/running the app.
This will build the Able.xcworkspace with the most updated dependencies from the Podfile. 

2. !IMPORTANT! Work in the Able.xcworkspace workspace not Able.xcodeproj. The first one is the one with the Pods and dependencies *


# TODO
*Will consider removing the latter from Github to avoid confusion.
