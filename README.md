# Able
iOS app for CS371L to connect people that can help one another.


## Notes
1. Everytime you __git pull__, make sure to run __pod install__ at the top-level before coding/running the app.
This will build the Able.xcworkspace with the most updated dependencies from the Podfile. 

2. !IMPORTANT! Work in the Able.xcworkspace workspace not Able.xcodeproj. The first one is the one with the Pods and dependencies 


## TODO
Will consider removing Able.xcodeproj from GitHub and leaving just Able.xcworkspace to avoid confusion.
